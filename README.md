Dataset compression plays a crucial role in modern data management and analytics. As the volume of data generated and collected continues to skyrocket, the need for efficient storage and processing becomes more pressing. While reducing the size of the dataset, it is essential to ensure that the compression is lossless i.e. the original dataset can be retrieved efficiently from the compressed dataset without any loss in information.
